This directory will be where I add my solutions to Java exercices I do in my free time.  I plan to always be adding to this as I find more problems to work on.  Check back often.

warmup - These are exercices from the website for Elements of Programming Interviews (http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/Warming-Up/).  I am gradually working through these quick ones.

euler - These are exercises from https://projecteuler.net/
