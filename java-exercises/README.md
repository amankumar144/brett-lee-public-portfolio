This directory will be where I add my solutions to Java exercices I do in my free time.  I plan to always be adding to this as I find more problems to work on.  Check back often.

Directory:
* euler - These are exercises from _Project Euler_ [https://projecteuler.net/]
* warmup - These are exercices from the website for _Elements of Programming Interviews_ [http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/Warming-Up/]
